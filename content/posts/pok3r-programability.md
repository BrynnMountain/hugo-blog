# Introduction
For anyone who is unaware, [mechanical keyboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8jX2DpHA5E) have taken the nerd world by storm over the last few years. I purchased my first mechanical keyboard, a [Das Model S Professional](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/), nearly six years ago now and I haven't looked back since. 

Today however, I want to talk about the keyboard I have been using for the last year, the [Vortex Pok3r](http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&kind2=220&kind3=&kind4=1010). With a small profile, sturdy design, and a few neat tricks up its sleeve, I think the Pok3r could become a favourite for anyone who spends a ton of time at the computer every day.

# What is the Pok3r?

Unlike the average mechanical keyboard these days, the Pok3r is unique in a few ways, the most notable being its size. It is what is referred to as a [60% keyboard](https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25), on account of it only featuring the inner 60% of a standard keyboard layout. (Meaning it only includes keys from `Esc` at the top left, to `Right CTRL` at the bottom right.)

To make up for the lack of keys however, the Pok3r features an awesome feature known as "Programability". Meaning it is able to be "programmed" to have any key on the keyboard act as any other key you would find on a keyboard.

# Programability Basics

First, there are a few basics to understand before we get into the specifics. The first is noting some keys you may not be familiar with. The `FN` and `PN` keys. The `FN` key is your function key, and if you are remotely familiar with keyboards you will know that this is useful for using media keys, changing brightness on laptops and many other alternative keyboard functions. The `PN` key is something you may be unfamiliar with. The `PN` key for the most part gets very little use in day-to-day use, but when it comes to the programability feature of the Pok3r, it is essential.

Second, the Pok3r uses something called "layering". What that means is that there are four unique layouts that the keyboard can remember. To switch between the layers simply press the `FN` key plus; `M`, `,`, `.`, or `/`. Each one of these switches the keyboard to a different layer. Which layer you are on can be noted by the colour of the LED's beneath the spacebar of the keyboard.
```
LED = OFF = Layer 1 (FN + M)
LED = Blue = Layer 2 (FN + ,)
LED = Red = Layer 3 (FN + .)
LED = Purple = Layer 4 (FN + /)
```
> NOTE: `Layer 1` (`FN + M`) cannot be programed. This layer will always use the default Pok3r layout.

# Getting Down To It

Alright, you're chocked full of useless keyboard knowledge, now let's turn it into semi-useful productivity knowledge. The first step is to choose the layer you wish to program. As I mentioned before, the first layer (where the spacebars LED is off) is not changeable. You can use any of the other three layers as you'd like, but because purple is the best colour, we'll use ***Layer 4***. So start by pressing `FN + /`.

Now, with your spacebars LED shining a proud purple we'll start off with the first thing I do on my board. The more I got into programming and design, the more I started to use the arrow keys to navigate my [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), or [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop)/[Illustrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator). Whatever program you frequent, most [power users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user) will know the arrow keys can be super useful. 

To begin, put the keyboard in "***Progamming Mode***" by pressing `FN + Right CTRL`. This will light the LED on the right of the spacebar a steady blue.

Next, select the key you want to change. For this exmaple we're going to make `W` act as our `Arrow Key Up` when `FN` is being held down. So to begin, press `FN + W`.

Your spacebars right LED will now be slowly blinking. Next, we will select which key we wish `FN + W` to act as. So we will press `FN + I`, which is the default `Arrow Key Up` on the Pok3r.

Finally, press `PN` to stop the programing process. The Right LED should be steady once more. Then Press `FN + Right CTRL` once more to leave "***Programming Mode***".

Now go to your favourite text editor and fill out a couple of lines with text. While holding down `FN` press `W`. If all went well, your cursor should begin climbing lines as if you were using your `Arrow Key Up`.

Now you may be saying "This doesn't seem any more practical than the default setting of `FN` + `I`, `J`, `K`, or `L`. But wait! There's more!

Unplug your keyboard from it's USB cable and turn it over. On the back you should see a set of four small [DIP Switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIP_switch). Change the `3` DIP Switch to `ON` from the `OFF` state, and plug your keyboard in once more.

Your `CapsLock` key will now function as your `FN` key. Which means you can easily navigate your IDE, Photoshop Art Board, Webpage, or whatever else you're working on with your pinky on `CapsLock` and your middle finger on `W`.

# How I Use My Pok3r

So if you follow the guide above, you can change over `A`, `S,` and `D` to be the `Arrow Key Left`, `Arrow Key Down`, and `Arrow Key Right` respectively. But how else can you utilize the programmability of the Pok3r? Below is a short list of what I have done to make use of my board:

- DIP Switch `3` is turned to `ON` in order to make `CapsLock` function as `FN`.
- `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` act as the `Arrow Keys` when `FN` is held down.
- `FN + Spacebar` is `Return`. Super helpful in Photoshop when trying to batch process images.
- `FN + Q`, `FN + E`, `FN + Z`, `FN + C`, and `FN + F` are `F8`, `F9`, `F10`, `F11`, and `F12` respectively which I bound to `Top left`, `Top Right`, `Bottom Left`, `Bottom Right`, and `Fullscreen` in [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) to re-arrange windows in OSX easily.
